# VIV(vortex induced vibration)涡激振动
This guide introduces to how to build a simple VIV model with PINNs in PaddleScience.nnn



## Use case introduction
The current model is a typical inverse problem application, and the VIV system is equivalent to a one-dimensional spring-damper system,as figure below.

<div align="center">
<img src="image/VIV_1D_SpringDamper.png" width = "400" align=center />
</div>


The governing equation is as follows, and *λ1* and *λ2* represent the natural damping and stiffness of the structure, *ρ* is mass. In this inverse problem, getting the value of *λ1* and *λ2* makes our goal. 
<div align="center">
<img src="image/VIV_eq.png" width = "200" align=center />
</div>

In order to verify the correctness of the inverse problem based on PINNS, the real values of stiffness and damping of the system are obtained in advance（*λ1=0，λ2=1.093*）. Comparing the stiffness and damping predicted by the model with the real value, if the relative error is less than 5%, we believe that the model can well simulate the one-dimensional vibration phenomenon of VIV and predict the physical properties of the unknown structure, such as some compicated structure.

This model assumes a constant reduction velocity `Ur=8.5（Ur=u/(fn*d))`, corresponding to `Re=500`. The lateral amplitude of cylinder vibration(*η*) caused by the velocity fluid flowing through the cylinder and the corresponding lift force（*f*） are recorded. These known data serve as the monitoring data of the training neural network and  are combined with the governing equation to form the total loss of the net.

## How to run this model

### Install PaddlePaddle and PaddleScience

**Install PaddlePaddle**

The PaddlePaddle development version is required, and user can choose the appropriate version based on simulating platform(such as in linux os and cuda10.1 platform, `python -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==0.0.0.post101 -f https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/whl/linux/gpu/develop.html` can be used for installing) on the [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/zh/develop/install/pip/linux-pip.html) 

**Download PaddleScience code**
 
        
   - Confirm working directory
        
   - Downlaod paddlescience code from  [github](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleScience), git clone is also worked by the following code:   
        
    git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleScience.git

 **Install dependent libraries**
 
    
   - Rename the folder name as PaddleScience if not
    
   - Change working directory to PaddleScience
    
   - Install dependent libraries by `pip install -r requirements` 
    
 **Set environment variables**
 
    
   **-Set environment** 
    
   Setting environment by `%env PYTHONPATH=/user_path*/PaddleScience`, and if editing bash files, using `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/user_path*/PaddleScience/` instead


### Confirm the governing equation 

The equation needs to be defined, as described earlier.

### Define the Network
Since only the lateral vibration of the structure is considered and the constant inlet velocity is given, the input of the network is only time(*t*), and the output is the vibration amplitude of the structure.
Selecting FCNet as the network with 6 layers and 30 neurons for each layer. The NeuralNetwork was defined in file `./examples/fsi/viv_inverse_train.py`as below:

```
PINN = psolver.PysicsInformedNeuralNetwork(layers=6, hidden_size=30, num_ins=1, num_outs=1, 
        t_max=tmax, t_min=tmin, N_f=f.shape[0], checkpoint_path='./examples/fsi/checkpoint/', net_params=net_params)
```

### Load data for monitoring
In this model, *η* and *f* were calculated by CFD tools and saved in *./examples/fsi/VIV_Training.mat* file. Loading data in file`./examples/fsi/viv_inverse_train.py` was as following:

```
t_eta, eta, t_f, f, tmin, tmax = data.build_data()
```
### Define PDE
PDE is defined in `./paddlescience/module/fsi/viv_pinn_solver.py` as below:
```
def neural_net_equations(self, t, u=None):
    eta = self.net.nn_func(t)
    eta_t = self.autograd(eta, t)
    eta_tt = self.autograd(eta_t, t, create_graph=False)

    rho = 2.0
    k1_ = paddle.exp(self.k1)
    k2_ = paddle.exp(self.k2)
    f = rho*eta_tt + k1_*eta_t + k2_*eta
    return eta, f
```     

### Define the PINN solver
PINN solver is depicted in `./paddlescience/module/fsi/viv_pinn_solver.py`. In this module, the loss function, autograd and optimizer, training methods are defined in detail. user can change the loss weight for eq and data when training.
In this model, the eta_weight and eq_weight are 100 and 1 respectively as default.
```
self.eta_weight = 100
```

### Train network
After completing the validation and definition mentioned above, Training can be started by executing `python ./examples/fsi/viv_inverse_train.py`

```
# Training
batchsize = 150
scheduler = paddle.optimizer.lr.StepDecay(learning_rate=1e-3, step_size=20000, gamma=0.9)
adm_opt = paddle.optimizer.Adam(scheduler, weight_decay=None,parameters=PINN.net.parameters())
PINN.train(num_epoch=100000, batchsize=batchsize, optimizer=adm_opt, scheduler=scheduler)
adm_opt = psci.optimizer.Adam(learning_rate=1e-5, weight_decay=None,parameters=PINN.net.parameters())
PINN.train(num_epoch=100000, batchsize=batchsize, optimizer=adm_opt)
```

### Predict Result
While training, net_params can be saved each 2000 epochs in `./examples/fsi/checkpoint` folder, and the latest net_params can be used to predict the result of traing time range by executing`python ./examples/fsi/viv_inverse_predict.py`. 

```
net_params = '/examples/fsi/checkpoint/net_params_100000'
predict(net_params=net_params)
```
The result is shown as below:
